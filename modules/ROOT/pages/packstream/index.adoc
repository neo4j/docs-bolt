:description: This section introduces the binary presentation format PackStream.

= PackStream

PackStream is a binary presentation format for the exchange of richly-typed data. It provides a syntax layer for the Bolt messaging protocol.

== Version 1

PackStream is a general purpose data serialisation format, originally inspired by (but incompatible with) link:https://msgpack.org/[MessagePack].

The format provides a type system fully compatible with the types supported by Cypher, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/[Cypher Manual -> Values and types] for more information.

PackStream offers a number of core data types, many supported by multiple binary representations, as well as a flexible extension mechanism.

The core data types are described in the table below.

|===

[NOTE]
====
Neither unsigned integers nor 32-bit floating point numbers are included.
This is a deliberate design decision to allow broader compatibility across client languages.

== General representation

Every serialised PackStream value begins with a *marker byte*.

The marker contains both data type information and direct or indirect size information for types that require it.
How that size information is encoded varies by marker type.

Some values, such as Boolean true, can be encoded within a single marker byte.
Many small integers (specifically between -16 and +127 inclusive) are also encoded within a single byte.

A number of marker bytes are reserved for future expansion of the format itself.
These bytes should not be used and encountering them in an incoming stream should treated as an error.

=== Sized values

Some representations are of a variable length and have their size explicitly encoded in the representation.
Such values generally begin with a single marker byte, followed by a size, followed by the data content itself.
In this context, the marker denotes both type and scale and therefore determines the number of bytes used to represent the size of the data.
The size itself is encoded as either an 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit unsigned integer.
Sizes longer than this are not supported.

The diagram below illustrates the general layout for a sized value, here with a 16-bit size:

image::packstream_sized_value.png[size=300]


=== Endianness

PackStream exclusively uses big-endian representations.
This means that the most significant part of the value is written to the network or memory space first and the least significant part is written last.

[[data-types]]
== Data types

[[data-type-null]]
=== `Null`

*Marker:* `C0`

`Null` is always encoded using the single marker byte `C0`.

[[data-type-boolean]]
=== `Boolean`

*Marker, false:* `C2`

*Marker, true:* `C3`

Boolean values are encoded within a single marker byte, using `C3` to denote *true* and `C2` to denote *false*.

*Marker, `INT_64`:* `CB`

Integer values occupy either 1, 2, 3, 5, or 9 bytes depending on magnitude.
The available representations are:

| `INT_64`
| 9
| `CB 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2A`
|===

Some marker bytes can be used to carry the value of a small integer as well as its type.
These markers can be identified by a zero high-order bit (for positive values) or by a high-order nibble containing only ones (for negative values).
Specifically, values between `00` and `7F` inclusive can be directly translated to and from positive integers with the same value.
Similarly, values between `F0` and `FF` inclusive can do the same for negative numbers between -16 and -1.

[NOTE]
====
While it is possible to encode small numbers in wider formats, it is generally recommended to use the most compact representation possible.

[[data-type-float]]
=== `Float`

*Marker:* `C1`

Floats are double-precision floating-point values, generally used for representing fractions and decimals.
They are encoded as a single C1 marker byte followed by 8 bytes which are formatted according to the IEEE 754 floating-point “double format” bit layout in big-endian order.

** Bit 63 (the bit that is selected by the mask `0x8000000000000000`) represents the sign of the number.
** Bits 62-52 (the bits that are selected by the mask `0x7ff0000000000000`) represent the exponent.
** Bits 51-0 (the bits that are selected by the mask `0x000fffffffffffff`) represent the significand (sometimes called the _mantissa_) of the number.

.Example with a decimal value
The value `1.23` in decimal can be represented as:
----
C1 3F F3 AE 14 7A E1 47 AE
----

[[data-type-bytes]]
=== `Bytes`

Bytes are arrays of byte values.
These are used to transmit raw binary data and the size represents the number of bytes contained.
Unlike other values, there is no separate encoding for byte arrays containing fewer than 16 bytes.

[cols="<10,<40,<20",options="header"]
|===
| Marker
| Size
| Maximum Size

|`CC`
| 8-bit big-endian unsigned integer
| 255 bytes

| `CD`
| 16-bit big-endian unsigned integer
| 65 535 bytes

| `CE`
| 32-bit big-endian unsigned integer
| 2 147 483 647 bytes
|===

One of the markers `CC`, `CD`, or `CE` should be used, depending on scale.
This marker is followed by the size and bytes themselves.

N.B. While the unsigned 32-bit integer following `CE` could hold a bigger number, the maximum size of byte arrays is limited to 2 147 483 647 (maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer).

.Example with empty byte array
Empty byte array `b[]`
----
CC 00
----

.Example with three values in byte array

| 65 535 bytes

| `D3`
| 32-bit big-endian unsigned integer
| 2 147 483 647 bytes
|===

Text data is represented as *UTF-8* encoded bytes.

[NOTE]
====
The sizes used in string representations are the byte counts of the UTF-8 encoded data, not the character count of the original text.
====

For encoded text containing fewer than 16 bytes, including empty strings, the marker byte should contain the high-order nibble `8` (binary 1000) followed by a low-order nibble containing the size.
The encoded data then immediately follows the marker.
For encoded text containing 16 bytes or more, the marker `D0`, `D1` or `D2` should be used, depending on scale.
This marker is followed by the size and the UTF-8 encoded data.

N.B. While the unsigned 32-bit integer following `D3` could hold a bigger number, the maximum byte size of strings is limited to 2 147 483 647 (maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer).

[[data-type-list]]
=== `List`

Lists are heterogeneous sequences of values and therefore permit a mixture of types within the same list.
The size of a list denotes the number of items within that list, rather than the total packed byte size.

*Markers:*

| `D6`
| 32-bit big-endian unsigned integer
| 2 147 483 647 items
|===

For lists containing fewer than 16 items, including empty lists, the marker byte should contain the high-order nibble `9` (binary 1001) followed by a low-order nibble containing the size.
The items within the list are then serialised in order immediately after the marker.

For lists containing 16 items or more, the marker `D4`, `D5` or `D6` should be used, depending on scale.
This marker is followed by the size and list items, serialized in order.

N.B. While the unsigned 32-bit integer following `D6` could hold a bigger number, the maximum size of lists is limited to 2 147 483 647 (maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer).

[[data-type-dictionary]]
=== `Dictionary`

A `Dictionary` is a list containing key-value entries:

** keys must be a `String`
** can contain multiple instances of the same key
** permit a mixture of types

The size of a `Dictionary` denotes the number of key-value entries within that dictionary, not the total packed byte size.

| `DA`
| 32-bit big-endian unsigned integer
| 2 147 483 647 entries
|===

For a dictionary containing fewer than 16 key-value entries, including an empty dictionary, the marker byte should contain the high-order nibble `A` (binary `1010`) followed by a low-order nibble containing the size.

The entries within the dictionary are then serialized in `[key, value, key, value]` order immediately after the marker.

[NOTE]
====
Keys are always `String` values.
====

For a dictionary containing 16 key-value entries or more, the marker `D8`, `D9` or `DA` should be used, depending on scale.
This marker is followed by the size and the key-value entries.

N.B. While the unsigned 32-bit integer following `DA` could hold a bigger number, the maximum size of dictionaries is limited to 2 147 483 647 (maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer).

[[data-type-structure]]
=== `Structure`

A structure is a composite value, comprised of fields and a unique type code.
Structure encodings consist, beyond the marker, of a single byte, the *tag byte*, followed by a sequence of up to 15 fields, each an individual value.
The size of a structure is measured as the number of fields and not the total byte size.
This count does not include the tag.

*Markers:*

| contained within low-order nibble of marker
| 14 fields

| `BF`
| contained within low-order nibble of marker
| 15 fields
|===

For structures containing fewer than 16 fields, the marker byte should contain the high-order nibble `B` (binary `1011`) followed by a low-order nibble containing the size.
The marker is immediately followed by the *tag byte* and the field values in that order.
The *tag byte* is used to identify the type or class of the structure and may hold any value between 0 and +127.

PackStream itself does not define semantics for different structures.
Instead, refer to the xref:bolt/structure-semantics.adoc[] for the Bolt version in question.
