:description: This section introduces the binary presentation format PackStream.

= PackStream

PackStream is a binary presentation format for the exchange of richly-typed data. It provides a syntax layer for the Bolt messaging protocol.

== Version 1

PackStream is a general purpose data serialisation format, originally inspired by (but incompatible with) link:https://msgpack.org/[MessagePack].

The format provides a type system fully compatible with the types supported by Cypher, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/values/[Cypher Manual -> Values and types] for more information.

PackStream offers a number of core data types, many supported by multiple binary representations, as well as a flexible extension mechanism.

The core data types are described in the table below.

.Core data types
[cols="20,60",options="header"]
|===
| Data type
| Description

| <<data-type-null, `Null`>>
| missing or empty value

| <<data-type-boolean, `Boolean`>>
| *true* or *false*

| <<data-type-integer, `Integer`>>
| signed 64-bit integer

| <<data-type-float, `Float`>>
| 64-bit floating point number

| <<data-type-bytes, `Bytes`>>
| byte array

| <<data-type-string, `String`>>
| unicode text, *UTF-8*

| <<data-type-list, `List`>>
| ordered collection of values

| <<data-type-dictionary, `Dictionary`>>
| collection of key-value entries (no order guaranteed)

| <<data-type-structure, `Structure`>>
| composite value with a type signature
|===

[NOTE]
====
Neither unsigned integers nor 32-bit floating point numbers are included.
This is a deliberate design decision to allow broader compatibility across client languages.

== General representation

Every serialised PackStream value begins with a *marker byte*.

The marker contains both data type information and direct or indirect size information for types that require it.
How that size information is encoded varies by marker type.

Some values, such as Boolean true, can be encoded within a single marker byte.
Many small integers (specifically between -16 and +127 inclusive) are also encoded within a single byte.

A number of marker bytes are reserved for future expansion of the format itself.
These bytes should not be used and encountering them in an incoming stream should treated as an error.

=== Sized values

Some representations are of a variable length and have their size explicitly encoded in the representation.
Such values generally begin with a single marker byte, followed by a size, followed by the data content itself.
In this context, the marker denotes both type and scale and therefore determines the number of bytes used to represent the size of the data.
The size itself is encoded as either an 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit unsigned integer.
Sizes longer than this are not supported.

The diagram below illustrates the general layout for a sized value, here with a 16-bit size:

image::packstream_sized_value.png[size=300]


=== Endianness

PackStream exclusively uses big-endian representations.
This means that the most significant part of the value is written to the network or memory space first and the least significant part is written last.

[[data-types]]
== Data types

[[data-type-null]]
=== `Null`

*Marker:* `C0`

`Null` is always encoded using the single marker byte `C0`.

[[data-type-boolean]]
=== `Boolean`

*Marker, false:* `C2`

*Marker, true:* `C3`

Boolean values are encoded within a single marker byte, using `C3` to denote *true* and `C2` to denote *false*.

[[data-type-integer]]
=== `Integer`

*Marker, `INT_8`:* `C8`

*Marker, `INT_16`:* `C9`

*Marker, `INT_32`:* `CA`

*Marker, `INT_64`:* `CB`

Integer values occupy either 1, 2, 3, 5, or 9 bytes depending on magnitude.
The available representations are:

| `CB 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2A`
|===

Some marker bytes can be used to carry the value of a small integer as well as its type.
These markers can be identified by a zero high-order bit (for positive values) or by a high-order nibble containing only ones (for negative values).
Specifically, values between `00` and `7F` inclusive can be directly translated to and from positive integers with the same value.
Similarly, values between `F0` and `FF` inclusive can do the same for negative numbers between -16 and -1.

[NOTE]
====
While it is possible to encode small numbers in wider formats, it is generally recommended to use the most compact representation possible.

The following table shows the optimal representation for every possible integer in the signed 64-bit range:

[[data-type-float]]
=== `Float`

*Marker:* `C1`

Floats are double-precision floating-point values, generally used for representing fractions and decimals.
They are encoded as a single C1 marker byte followed by 8 bytes which are formatted according to the IEEE 754 floating-point “double format” bit layout in big-endian order.

** Bit 63 (the bit that is selected by the mask 0x8000000000000000) represents the sign of the number.
** Bits 62-52 (the bits that are selected by the mask 0x7ff0000000000000) represent the exponent.
** Bits 51-0 (the bits that are selected by the mask 0x000fffffffffffff) represent the significand (sometimes called the _mantissa_) of the number.

.Example with a decimal value
The value *1.23 in decimal* can be represented as:
----
C1 3F F3 AE 14 7A E1 47 AE
----

[[data-type-bytes]]
=== `Bytes`

Bytes are arrays of byte values.
These are used to transmit raw binary data and the size represents the number of bytes contained.
Unlike other values, there is no separate encoding for byte arrays containing fewer than 16 bytes.

[cols="<10,<40,<20",options="header"]
|===
| Marker
| Size
| Maximum Size

|`CC`
| 8-bit big-endian unsigned integer

| 16-bit big-endian unsigned integer
| 65 535 bytes

| `CE`
| 32-bit big-endian unsigned integer
| 2 147 483 647 bytes
|===

One of the markers `CC`, `CD`, or `CE` should be used, depending on scale.
This marker is followed by the size and bytes themselves.

| `D3`
| 32-bit big-endian unsigned integer
| 2 147 483 647 bytes
|===

Text data is represented as *UTF-8* encoded bytes.

[NOTE]
====
The sizes used in string representations are the byte counts of the UTF-8 encoded data, not the character count of the original text.
====

For encoded text containing fewer than 16 bytes, including empty strings, the marker byte should contain the high-order nibble ´8´ (binary 1000) followed by a low-order nibble containing the size.
The encoded data then immediately follows the marker.
For encoded text containing 16 bytes or more, the marker `D0`, `D1` or `D2` should be used, depending on scale.
This marker is followed by the size and the UTF-8 encoded data.

[[data-type-list]]
=== `List`

Lists are heterogeneous sequences of values and therefore permit a mixture of types within the same list.
The size of a list denotes the number of items within that list, rather than the total packed byte size.

|===

For lists containing fewer than 16 items, including empty lists, the marker byte should contain the high-order nibble ´9´ (binary 1001) followed by a low-order nibble containing the size.
The items within the list are then serialised in order immediately after the marker.

For lists containing 16 items or more, the marker `D4`, `D5` or `D6` should be used, depending on scale.
This marker is followed by the size and list items, serialized in order.

For a dictionary containing fewer than 16 key-value entries, including an empty dictionary, the marker byte should contain the high-order nibble ´A´ (binary 1010) followed by a low-order nibble containing the size.

The entries within the dictionary are then serialized in `[key, value, key, value]` order immediately after the marker.

[NOTE]

[[data-type-structure]]
=== `Structure`

A structure is a composite value, comprised of fields and a unique type code.
Structure encodings consist, beyond the marker, of a single byte, the *tag byte*, followed by a sequence of up to 15 fields, each an individual value.
The size of a structure is measured as the number of fields and not the total byte size.
This count does not include the tag.

For structures containing fewer than 16 fields, the marker byte should contain the high-order nibble ´B´ (binary 1011) followed by a low-order nibble containing the size.
The marker is immediately followed by the *tag byte* and the field values in that order.
The *tag byte* is used to identify the type or class of the structure and may hold any value between 0 and +127.

[[structure-path]]
==== `Path`

An alternating sequence of nodes and relationships.

*tag byte:* `50`

*Number of fields:* 3
----
Path::Structure(
    nodes::List<Node>,
    rels::List<UnboundRelationship>,
    indices::List<Integer>,
)
----

Where the `nodes` field contains a list of nodes and the `rels` field is a list of unbound relationships.
The `indices` are a list of integers describing how to construct the path from `nodes` and `rels`.
The first node in `nodes` is always the first node in the path and is not referenced in `indices`.
`indices` always has an even number of entries.
The 1st, 3rd, ... entry in `indices` refers to an entry in `rels` (1-indexed), for example, a `3` would refer to the 3rd element of `rels`.
The number can also be negative which should be treated like the positive equivalent, except for denoting the relationship in the inverse direction.
The number is never `0`.
The 2nd, 4th, ... entry in `indices` refers to an entry in `nodes` (0-indexed), for example, a `3` would refer the 2nd element of `nodes`.
The number is always `≥ 0`.

.Example (simplified notation for `<Node>` and `<UnboundRelationship>`)
----
Path::Structure(
    nodes: [Node::Structure(42, ...), Node::Structure(69, ...), Node::Structure(1, ...)],
    rels: [UnboundRelationship::Structure(1000, ...), UnboundRelationship::Structure(1001, ...)],
    indices: [1, 1, 1, 0, -2, 2],
----

This represents the path `(42)-[1000]->(69)-[1000]->(42)<-[1001]-(1)`, where `(n)` denotes a node with id `n` and `[n]` a relationship with id `n` (`->` or `<-` denotes the direction of each relationship).


[[structure-date]]
==== `Date`

A date without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system, e.g. “2007-12-03”.

*tag byte:* `44`

*Number of fields:* 2
----
Time::Structure(
    nanoseconds::Integer,
    tz_offset_seconds::Integer,
)
----

Where the `nanoseconds` are nanoseconds since midnight (this time is _not_ UTC) and the `tz_offset_seconds` are an offset in seconds from UTC.

To convert to UTC, use:
----
utc_nanoseconds = nanoseconds - (tz_offset_seconds * 1000000000)
----

[[structure-time]]
==== `Time`

An instant capturing the time of day, and the timezone, but not the date.

*tag byte:* `54`

*Number of fields:* 2
----
Time::Structure(
    nanoseconds::Integer,
    tz_offset_seconds::Integer,
)
----

Where the `nanoseconds` are nanoseconds since midnight (this time is _not_ UTC) and the `tz_offset_seconds` are an offset in seconds from UTC.


[[structure-localtime]]
==== `LocalTime`

An instant capturing the time of day, but neither the date nor the time zone.

*tag byte:* `74`

*Number of fields:* 1
----
LocalTime::Structure(
    nanoseconds::Integer,
)
----

Where the `nanoseconds` are nanoseconds since midnight.

[[structure-datetime]]
==== `DateTime`

An instant capturing the date, the time, and the time zone.
The time zone information is specified with a zone offset.

*tag byte:* `46`

*Number of fields:* 3
----
DateTime::Structure(
    seconds::Integer,
    nanoseconds::Integer,
    tz_offset_seconds::Integer,
)
----

- The `tz_offset_seconds` specifies the offset in seconds from UTC.
- The `seconds` elapsed since the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)[Unix epoch], often referred as a Unix timestamp, **added** to the above offset.
- The `nanoseconds` are what remains after the last second of the `DateTime`. 
The amount of `nanoseconds` ranges from `0` to `999_999_999` (`_` separator added here and later for clarity).

For instance, the serialization of the point in time denoted as `1970-01-01T02:15:00+01:00` (and `42` nanoseconds) can be implemented as follows:

- compute the UTC time, i.e. `1970-01-01T01:15:00Z` (`Z` denotes UTC).
- compute the difference between that UTC time and the Unix epoch, which is 1h15, i.e. `4_500` seconds.
- add the offset of +1 hour, i.e. `3_600` seconds, to the above difference, which yields `8_100` (`4_500`+`3_600`)

The resulting `DateTime` instance is therefore as follows:

----
{
  seconds: 8100
  nanoseconds: 42,
  tz_offset_seconds: 3600
}
----

The deserialization of such a `DateTime` structure expectedly happens in reverse:

- remove the offset from the `seconds` field, which gives here `8_100`
- instantiate the idiomatic equivalent of `DateTime` based on that Unix timestamp, giving `1970-01-01T01:15:00Z`
- localize the resulting UTC `DateTime` to the timezone of the specified offset, giving `1970-01-01T02:15:00+0100`

[[structure-datetimezoneid]]
==== `DateTimeZoneId`

An instant capturing the date, the time, and the time zone.
The time zone information is specified with a zone identifier.

*tag byte:* `66`

*Number of fields:* 3
----
DateTimeZoneId::Structure(
    seconds::Integer,
    nanoseconds::Integer,
    tz_id::String,
)
----

- The `tz_id` specifies the timezone name as understood by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database[the timezone database].
- The `seconds` elapsed since the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)[Unix epoch], often referred as a Unix timestamp, **added** to the offset derived from the named timezone and specified the point in time.
- The `nanoseconds` are what remains after the last second of the `DateTime`. 
`999_999_999` (`_` separator added here and later for clarity).

For instance, the serialization of the point in time denoted as `1970-01-01T02:15:00+0100[Europe/Paris]` (and `42`
nanoseconds) can be implemented as follows:

- retrieve the offset of the named timezone for that point in time, here +1 hour, i.e. `3_600` seconds
- compute the UTC time, i.e. `1970-01-01T01:15:00Z` (`Z` denotes UTC)
- compute the difference between that UTC time and the Unix epoch, which is 1h15, i.e. `4_500` seconds.
- add the resolved offset of +1 hour, i.e. `3_600` seconds, to the above difference, which yields `8_100` (`4_500`+`3_600`)

The resulting `DateTime` instance is therefore as follows:

----
{
  seconds: 8100
  nanoseconds: 42,
  tz_id: "Europe/Paris"
}
----

The deserialization of such a `DateTime` structure happens as follows:

- instantiate the idiomatic equivalent of `DateTime` assuming the seconds denote a Unix timestamp, giving
`1970-01-01T02:15:00Z`
- set the timezone of the resulting instance, without changing the date/time components, giving
`1970-01-01T02:15:00+0100[Europe/Paris]` (this may lead to ambiguities, read the `Known Limitations` section below to
learn more)

===== Known Limitations

====== Accuracy

The resolution of offsets for a given time zone name and point in time is bound to the accuracy of the underlying
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database[timezone database]. In
particular, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database#Data_before_1970[time zones before 1970] are not as well
specified.

Moreover, the offset resolution likely occurs both on the Bolt client side and Bolt server side. They each rely on a
different timezone database. That could lead to unwanted discrepancies if these copies are not in sync.

In such a situation, either server or client could:

- reject a timezone name deemed valid by the other party
- resolve different offsets for the same time zone and `DateTimeZoneId`.

====== Time Shifts

Not all instances of `DateTimeZoneId` map to a single valid point in time.

1. During time shifts like going from 2AM to 3AM in a given day and timezone, 2:30AM e.g. does not happen.
2. Similarly, when going from 3AM to 2AM in a given day and timezone, 2:30AM happens twice.

In the first case, a `DateTimeZoneId` specifying a time between 2AM and 3AM does not correspond to any actual points in
time for that timezone and is invalid.

In the second case, all points in the time between 2AM and 3AM exist twice, but with a different offset.
Therefore, the timezone name is not sufficient to resolve the ambiguity, the timezone offset is also needed.
Since `DateTimeZoneId` does not include the timezone offset, the resolution of these particular datetimes is an
undefined behavior.

[[structure-localdatetime]]
==== `LocalDateTime`

An instant capturing the date and the time but not the time zone.

*tag byte:* `64`

*Number of fields:* 2
----
LocalDateTime::Structure(
    seconds::Integer,
    nanoseconds::Integer,
)
----

Where the `seconds` are seconds since the Unix epoch.


[[structure-duration]]
==== `Duration`

A temporal amount.
This captures the difference in time between two instants.
It only captures the amount of time between two instants, it does not capture a start time and end time.
A unit capturing the start time and end time would be a `Time Interval` and is out of scope for this proposal.

A duration can be negative.
