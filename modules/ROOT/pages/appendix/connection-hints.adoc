# Connection hints

As of version 4.3, the server may optionally include a set of configuration hints within the `SUCCESS` metadata provided in response to the `HELLO` message.
Drivers may choose to interpret or ignore these hints at their own discretion.
The following set of hints are currently defined.

## connection.recv_timeout_seconds - v4.3

Maximum amount of time (in seconds) for which a connection may remain idle following a request before drivers should consider it stale.

The server will ensure that a chunk (or `NOOP` chunk) will be transmitted at least once per timeout period. Drivers which choose to interpret this hint may terminate connections which are considered stale by the definition of this hint.
