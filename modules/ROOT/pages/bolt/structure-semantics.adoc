:description: This section describes struct semantics per Bolt Protocol version.

= Structure Semantics

While PackStream defines what a xref::/packstream/index.adoc#data-type-structure[Structure] looks like, it does not define what it means.
The semantics of Structures are bound to the Bolt Protocol version.

The table below lists the PackStream specified structures and their code and tag byte across all currently existing Bolt Protocol versions.

[[structure-unbound]]
=== `UnboundRelationship`

----
----
B4 72
...
----

[[structure-path]]
=== `Path`

An alternating sequence of nodes and relationships.

*tag byte:* `50`

*Number of fields:* 3
----
Path::Structure(
    nodes::List<Node>,
    rels::List<UnboundRelationship>,
    indices::List<Integer>,
)
----

Where the `nodes` field contains a list of nodes and the `rels` field is a list of unbound relationships.
The `indices` are a list of integers describing how to construct the path from `nodes` and `rels`.
The first node in `nodes` is always the first node in the path and is not referenced in `indices`.
`indices` always has an even number of entries.
The 1st, 3rd, ... entry in `indices` refers to an entry in `rels` (1-indexed), for example, a `3` would refer to the 3rd element of `rels`.
The number can also be negative which should be treated like the positive equivalent, except for denoting the relationship in the inverse direction.
The number is never `0`.
The 2nd, 4th, ... entry in `indices` refers to an entry in `nodes` (0-indexed), for example, a `3` would refer the 2nd element of `nodes`.
The number is always `â‰¥ 0`.

.Example (simplified notation for `<Node>` and `<UnboundRelationship>`)
----
Path::Structure(
    nodes: [Node::Structure(42, ...), Node::Structure(69, ...), Node::Structure(1, ...)],
    rels: [UnboundRelationship::Structure(1000, ...), UnboundRelationship::Structure(1001, ...)],
    indices: [1, 1, 1, 0, -2, 2],
----

This represents the path `(42)-[1000]->(69)-[1000]->(42)<-[1001]-(1)`, where `(n)` denotes a node with id `n` and `[n]` a relationship with id `n` (`->` or `<-` denotes the direction of each relationship).


[[structure-date]]
=== `Date`

A date without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system, e.g. `2007-12-03`.

*tag byte:* `44`

*Number of fields:* 1
----
Date::Structure(
    days::Integer,
)
----

Where the `days` are days since https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)[Unix epoch]. `0` for example represents 1970-01-01 while `1` represents 1970-01-02.

[[structure-time]]
=== `Time`

An instant capturing the time of day, and the timezone, but not the date.

*tag byte:* `54`

*Number of fields:* 2
----
Time::Structure(
    nanoseconds::Integer,
    tz_offset_seconds::Integer,
)
----

Where the `nanoseconds` are nanoseconds since midnight (this time is _not_ UTC) and the `tz_offset_seconds` are an offset in seconds from UTC.


[[structure-localtime]]
=== `LocalTime`

An instant capturing the time of day, but neither the date nor the time zone.

*tag byte:* `74`

*Number of fields:* 1
----
LocalTime::Structure(
    nanoseconds::Integer,
)
----

Where the `nanoseconds` are nanoseconds since midnight.

[[structure-datetime]]
=== `DateTime`

An instant capturing the date, the time, and the time zone.
The time zone information is specified with a zone offset.

_This structure is new in version *5.0*._
It replaces <<structure-legacy-datetime>> and fixes a bug in certain edge-cases.
Version *4.4* also allows for usage of the fixed structure, if server and client negotiate its usage (see xref:bolt/message.adoc#messages-hello[`HELLO` message]).

*tag byte:* `49`

*Number of fields:* 3
----
DateTime::Structure(
    seconds::Integer,
    nanoseconds::Integer,
    tz_offset_seconds::Integer,
)
----

- The `seconds` and `nanoseconds` are the time since https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)[Unix epoch], often referred as a Unix timestamp.
- The amount of `nanoseconds` ranges from `0` to `999_999_999` (`_` separator added here and later for clarity).
- The `tz_offset_seconds` specifies the offset in seconds from UTC.


For instance, the serialization of the point in time denoted as `1970-01-01T02:15:00.000000042+01:00` can be implemented as follows:

- compute the UTC time, i.e. `1970-01-01T01:15:00.000000042Z` (`Z` denotes UTC).
- compute the difference between that UTC time and the Unix epoch, which is 1h15, i.e. `4_500` seconds.

The resulting `DateTime` instance is therefore as follows:

----
{
  seconds: 4500
  nanoseconds: 42,
  tz_offset_seconds: 3600
}
----

The deserialization of such a `DateTime` structure expectedly happens in reverse:

- instantiate the idiomatic equivalent of `DateTime` based on that Unix timestamp (`4500` seconds and `42` nanoseconds), giving `1970-01-01T01:15:00.000000042Z`
- localize the resulting UTC `DateTime` to the timezone of the specified offset, giving `1970-01-01T02:15:00.000000042+0100`

[[structure-datetimezoneid]]
=== `DateTimeZoneId`

An instant capturing the date, the time, and the time zone.
The time zone information is specified with a zone identifier.

_This structure is new in version *5.0*._
It replaces <<structure-legacy-datetimezoneid>> and fixes a bug in certain edge-cases.
Version *4.4* also allows for usage of the fixed structure, if server and client negotiate its usage (see xref:bolt/message.adoc#messages-hello[`HELLO` message]).

*tag byte:* `69`

*Number of fields:* 3
----
DateTimeZoneId::Structure(
    seconds::Integer,
    nanoseconds::Integer,
    tz_id::String,
)
----

- The `seconds` and `nanoseconds` are the time since https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)[Unix epoch], often referred as a Unix timestamp.
- The amount of `nanoseconds` ranges from `0` to `999_999_999` (`_` separator added here and later for clarity).
- The `tz_id` specifies the timezone name as understood by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database[the timezone database].

For instance, the serialization of the point in time denoted as `1970-01-01T02:15:00.000000042+0100[Europe/Paris]` can be implemented as follows:

- retrieve the offset of the named timezone for that point in time, here +1 hour, i.e. `3_600` seconds.
- compute the UTC time, i.e. `1970-01-01T01:15:00.000000042Z` (`Z` denotes UTC).
- compute the difference between that UTC time and the Unix epoch, which is 1h15, i.e. `4_500` seconds.

The resulting `DateTime` instance is therefore as follows:

----
{
  seconds: 4500
  nanoseconds: 42,
  tz_id: "Europe/Paris"
}
----

The deserialization of such a `DateTime` structure happens in reverse:

- instantiate the idiomatic equivalent of `DateTime` based on that Unix timestamp (`4500` seconds and `42` nanoseconds), giving `1970-01-01T01:15:00.000000042Z`
- localize the resulting UTC `DateTime` to the timezone specified by `tz_id`, giving `1970-01-01T02:15:00.000000042+0100[Europe/Paris]`


==== Known Limitations

===== Accuracy

The resolution of offsets for a given time zone name and point in time is bound to the accuracy of the underlying link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database[timezone database].
In particular, link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database#Data_before_1970[time zones before 1970] are not as well specified.
Moreover, the offset resolution likely occurs both on the Bolt client side and Bolt server side.
They each rely on a different timezone database.
If these copies are not in sync, it could lead to unwanted discrepancies.
In such a situation, either server or client could:

- reject a timezone name deemed valid by the other party.
- resolve different offsets for the same time zone and `DateTimeZoneId`.


[[structure-localdatetime]]
=== `LocalDateTime`

An instant capturing the date and the time but not the time zone.

*tag byte:* `64`

*Number of fields:* 2
----
LocalDateTime::Structure(
    seconds::Integer,
    nanoseconds::Integer,
)
----

Where the `seconds` are seconds since the Unix epoch.


[[structure-duration]]
=== `Duration`

A temporal amount.
This captures the difference in time between two instants.
It only captures the amount of time between two instants, it does not capture a start time and end time.
A unit capturing the start time and end time would be a `Time Interval` and is out of scope for this proposal.

A duration can be negative.

*tag byte:* `45`

*Number of fields:* 4
----
Duration::Structure(
    months::Integer,
    days::Integer,
    seconds::Integer,
    nanoseconds::Integer,
)
----

[[structure-point2d]]
=== `Point2D`

A representation of a single location in 2-dimensional space.

*tag byte:* `58`

*Number of fields:* 3
----
Point2D::Structure(
    srid::Integer,
    x::Float,
    y::Float,
)
----

Where the `srid` is a _Spatial Reference System Identifier_.

[[structure-point3d]]
=== `Point3D`

A representation of a single location in 3-dimensional space.

*tag byte:* `59`

*Number of fields:* 4
----
Point3D::Structure(
    srid::Integer,
    x::Float,
    y::Float,
    z::Float,
)
----

Where the `srid` is a _Spatial Reference System Identifier_.

== Legacy Structures

[[structure-legacy-datetime]]
=== `Legacy DateTime`

An instant capturing the date, the time, and the time zone.
The time zone information is specified with a zone offset.

_This structure got removed in version *5.0* in favor of
<<structure-datetime>>._

*tag byte:* `46`

*Number of fields:* 3
----
DateTime::Structure(
    seconds::Integer,
    nanoseconds::Integer,
    tz_offset_seconds::Integer,
)
----

- The `tz_offset_seconds` specifies the offset in seconds from UTC.
- The `seconds` elapsed since the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)[Unix epoch], often referred as a Unix timestamp, **added** to the above offset.
- The `nanoseconds` are what remains after the last second of the `DateTime`.
The amount of `nanoseconds` ranges from `0` to `999_999_999` (`_` separator added here for clarity).

For instance, the serialization of the point in time denoted as `1970-01-01T02:15:00+01:00` (and `42` nanoseconds) can be implemented as follows:

- compute the UTC time, i.e. `1970-01-01T01:15:00Z` (`Z` denotes UTC).
- compute the difference between that UTC time and the Unix epoch, which is 1h15, i.e. `4500` seconds.
- add the offset of +1 hour, i.e. `3600` seconds, to the above difference, which yields `8100` (`4500` + `3600`).

The resulting `DateTime` instance is therefore as follows:

----
{
  seconds: 8100
  nanoseconds: 42,
  tz_offset_seconds: 3600
}
----

The deserialization of such a `DateTime` structure expectedly happens in reverse:

- remove the offset from the `seconds` field, which gives here `8100`
- instantiate the idiomatic equivalent of `DateTime` based on that Unix timestamp, giving `1970-01-01T01:15:00Z`
- localize the resulting UTC `DateTime` to the timezone of the specified offset, giving `1970-01-01T02:15:00+0100`

[[structure-legacy-datetimezoneid]]
=== `Legacy DateTimeZoneId`

An instant capturing the date, the time, and the time zone.
The time zone information is specified with a zone identifier.

_This structure got removed in version *5.0* in favor of
<<structure-datetimezoneid>>._

*tag byte:* `66`

*Number of fields:* 3
----
DateTimeZoneId::Structure(
    seconds::Integer,
    nanoseconds::Integer,
    tz_id::String,
)
----

- The `tz_id` specifies the timezone name as understood by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database[the timezone database].
- The `seconds` elapsed since the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)[Unix epoch], often referred as a Unix timestamp, **added** to the offset derived from the named timezone and specified the point in time.
- The `nanoseconds` are what remains after the last second of the `DateTime`.
The amount of nanoseconds ranges from `0` to `999_999_999` (`_` separator added here and later for clarity).

For instance, the serialization of the point in time denoted as `1970-01-01T02:15:00+0100[Europe/Paris]` (and `42` nanoseconds) can be implemented as follows:

- retrieve the offset of the named timezone for that point in time, here +1 hour, i.e. `3600` seconds.
- compute the UTC time, i.e. `1970-01-01T01:15:00Z` (`Z` denotes UTC).
- compute the difference between that UTC time and the Unix epoch, which is 1h15, i.e. `4500` seconds.
- add the resolved offset of +1 hour, i.e. `3600` seconds, to the above difference, which yields `8100` (`4500` + `3600`).

The resulting `DateTime` instance is therefore as follows:

----
{
  seconds: 8100
  nanoseconds: 42,
  tz_id: "Europe/Paris"
}
----

The deserialization of such a `DateTime` structure happens as follows:

- instantiate the idiomatic equivalent of `DateTime` assuming the seconds denote a Unix timestamp, giving `1970-01-01T02:15:00Z`.
- set the timezone of the resulting instance, without changing the date/time components, giving `1970-01-01T02:15:00+0100[Europe/Paris]` (this may lead to ambiguities, refer to the `Known Limitations` section below for more information).

==== Known Limitations

===== Accuracy

The resolution of offsets for a given time zone name and point in time is bound to the accuracy of the underlying link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database[timezone database].
In particular, link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database#Data_before_1970[time zones before 1970] are not as well specified.
Moreover, the offset resolution likely occurs both on the Bolt client side and Bolt server side.
They each rely on a different timezone database.
If these copies are not in sync, it could lead to unwanted discrepancies.
In such a situation, either server or client could:

- reject a timezone name deemed valid by the other party.
- resolve different offsets for the same time zone and `DateTimeZoneId`.

===== Time Shifts

_Note: these issues have been resolved with the introduction of <<structure-datetimezoneid>> in version *5.0*._

Not all instances of `DateTimeZoneId` map to a single valid point in time.

1. During time shifts like going from 2AM to 3AM in a given day and timezone, 2:30AM e.g. does not happen.
2. Similarly, when going from 3AM to 2AM in a given day and timezone, 2:30AM happens twice.

In the first case, a `DateTimeZoneId` specifying a time between 2AM and 3AM does not correspond to any actual points in time for that timezone and is invalid.

In the second case, all points in the time between 2AM and 3AM exist twice, but with a different offset.
Therefore, the timezone name is not sufficient to resolve the ambiguity, the timezone offset is also needed.
Since `DateTimeZoneId` does not include the timezone offset, the resolution of these particular datetimes is undefined behavior.
