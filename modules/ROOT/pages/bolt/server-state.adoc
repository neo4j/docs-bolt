:description: This section describes the server state specifications for the Bolt Protocol.

= Bolt Protocol server state specification

For the server, each connection using the Bolt Protocol will occupy one of several states throughout its lifetime.

This state is used to determine what actions may be undertaken by the client.
Each server state specification corresponds to a message specification with the same version.

For a summary of all available server state transitions in each version of the Bolt Protocol, see the Appendix pages.

[[server-states]]
== Server states

Each *connection* maintained by a Bolt server will occupy one of several states throughout its lifetime.
This state is used to determine what actions may be undertaken by the client.

|===


[[server-disconnected]]
=== Server state `DISCONNECTED`

No *socket connection* has yet been established.
This is the initial state and exists only in a logical sense prior to the socket being opened.

==== Transitions from `DISCONNECTED`

** Bolt handshake completed successfully to `NEGOTIATION`
** Bolt handshake did not complete successfully to `DEFUNCT`

[[server-negotiation]]
=== Server state `NEGOTIATION`

After a new *protocol connection* has been established and handshake has been completed successfully, the server enters the `NEGOTIATION` state.
The connection has not yet been authenticated and permits only one transition, through successful initialization using the `HELLO` message, into the `AUTHENTICATION` state.

==== Transitions from `NEGOTIATION`

** `<DISCONNECT>` to `DEFUNCT`
** `HELLO` to `AUTHENTICATION` or `DEFUNCT`

[[server-authentication]]
=== Server state `AUTHENTICATION`

Connection has been established and metadata has been sent back from the `HELLO` message or a `LOGOFF` message was received whilst in ready state.
Ready to accept a `LOGON` message with authentication information.

==== Transitions from `NEGOTIATION`
** `LOGON` to `READY` or `DEFUNCT`

==== Transitions from `READY`
** `LOGOFF` to `AUTHENTICATION`

[[server-defunct]]
=== Server state `DEFUNCT`

This is not strictly a connection state, but is instead a logical state that exists after a connection has been closed.
When `DEFUNCT`, a connection is permanently not usable.
This may arise due to a graceful shutdown or can occur after an unrecoverable error or protocol violation.
Clients and servers should clear up any resources associated with a connection on entering this state, including closing any open sockets.
This is a terminal state on which no further transitions may be carried out.
The `<DISCONNECT>` signal will set the connection in the `DEFUNCT` server state.

[[server-ready]]
=== Server state `READY`

The `READY` state can handle the request messages `RUN` and `BEGIN` and receive a query.

==== Transitions from `READY`

** `<INTERRUPT>` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `<DISCONNECT>` to `DEFUNCT`
** `RUN` to `STREAMING` or `FAILED`
** `BEGIN` to `TX_READY` or `FAILED` (v3+)
** `LOGOFF` to `AUTHENTICATION` (v5.1+)


[[server-streaming]]
=== Server state `STREAMING`

When `STREAMING`, a result is available for streaming from server to client.
This result must be fully consumed or discarded by a client before the server can re-enter the `READY` state and allow any further queries to be executed.

==== Transitions from `STREAMING`

** `<INTERRUPT>` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `<DISCONNECT>` to `DEFUNCT`
** `PULL` to `READY`, `FAILED`, or `STREAMING`
** `DISCARD` to `READY`, `FAILED`, or `STREAMING`

In v1, v2 and v3, the following transitions are possible:

** `<INTERRUPT>` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `<DISCONNECT>` to `DEFUNCT`
** `PULL_ALL` to `READY` or `FAILED`
** `DISCARD_ALL` to `READY` or `FAILED`

=== Server state `TX_READY`

==== Transitions from `TX_READY`

** `<INTERRUPT>` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `<DISCONNECT>` to `DEFUNCT`
** `RUN` to `TX_STREAMING` or `FAILED`
** `COMMIT` to `READY` or `FAILED`

[[server-tx-streaming]]
=== Server state `TX_STREAMING`

When `TX_STREAMING`, a result is available for streaming from server to client.
This result must be fully consumed or discarded by a client before the server can transition to the `TX_READY` state.

==== Transitions from `TX_STREAMING`

** `<INTERRUPT>` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `<DISCONNECT>` to `DEFUNCT`

|===

[NOTE]
====
The `TX_STREAMING` server state does not exist in v1 or v2.
====

[[server-failed]]
=== Server state `FAILED`

When `FAILED`, a connection is in a temporarily unusable state.
This is generally as the result of encountering a recoverable error.
This mode ensures that only one failure can exist at a time, preventing cascading issues from batches of work.

==== Transitions from `FAILED`

** `<INTERRUPT>` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `<DISCONNECT>` to `DEFUNCT`
** `RUN` to `FAILED`
** `PULL` to `FAILED`
** `DISCARD` to `FAILED`

_In v1 and v2, in a `FAILED` state, no more work will be processed until the failure has been acknowledged by `ACK_FAILURE` or until the connection has been `RESET`._

In v1 and v2, the following transitions are possible:

** `<INTERRUPT>` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `<DISCONNECT>` to `DEFUNCT`
** `ACK_FAILURE` to `READY` or `DEFUNCT`

[[server-interrupted]]
=== Server state `INTERRUPTED`

This state occurs between the server receiving the jump-ahead `<INTERRUPT>` and the queued `RESET` message, (the `RESET` message triggers an `<INTERRUPT>`).
Most incoming messages are ignored when the server are in an `INTERRUPTED` state, with the exception of the `RESET` that allows transition back to READY.
The `<INTERRUPT>` signal will set the connection in the `INTERRUPTED` server state.

==== Transitions from `INTERRUPTED`

** `<INTERRUPT>` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `<DISCONNECT>` to `DEFUNCT`
** `RUN` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `DISCARD` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `PULL` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `BEGIN` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `COMMIT` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `ROLLBACK` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `RESET` to `READY` or `DEFUNCT`

In v1 and v2, the following transitions are possible:

** `<INTERRUPT>` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `<DISCONNECT>` to `DEFUNCT`
** `RUN` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `DISCARD_ALL` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `PULL_ALL` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `ACK_FAILURE` to `INTERRUPTED`
** `RESET` to `READY` or `DEFUNCT`

The sections below list the changes compared to the previous version.

=== Version 5.2

No changes compared to version 5.1.

=== Version 5.1

** `CONNECTED` state has been renamed to `NEGOTIATION` but still accepts the `HELLO` message.
** `HELLO` message no longer accepts authentication and transitions to the `AUTHENTICATION` state from `NEGOTIATION`.
** `LOGON` message has been added.
It can only be received in the `AUTHENTICATION` state and transitions to the `READY` state.
** `LOGOFF` message has be added.
It can only be received in the `READY` state and transitions to the `AUTHENTICATION` state.

=== Version 5.0

No changes compared to version 4.4.

=== Version 4.4

No changes compared to version 4.3.

=== Version 4.3

** The `ROUTE` message was added.

=== Version 4.1

No changes compared to version 4.0.

=== Version 4.0

Compared to version 3 the `RUN`, `PULL` and `DISCARD` now can re-enter `STREAMING` or `TX_STREAMING`.

=== Version 3

Compared to version 2 there are new server states:

** `TX_READY`
** `TX_STREAMING`
These states are introduced to handle the concept of *Explicit Transaction*.
