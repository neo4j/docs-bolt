:description: This section describes the Bolt Protocol message specification.

= Bolt Protocol message specification

The message specification describes the message exchanges that take place on a connection following a successful Bolt handshake.
For details of establishing a connection and performing a handshake, see xref:bolt/handshake.adoc[].

The Bolt protocol communicates with specific versioned messages.

== Bolt Protocol server state specification

For the server, each connection using the Bolt Protocol will occupy one of several states throughout its lifetime.
This state is used to determine what actions may be undertaken by the client.

For more information, see the corresponding version of the xref:bolt/server-state.adoc[].

[[server-signals]]
===  Server signals

_Jump ahead_ means that the signal is immediately available before any messages are processed in the message queue.

[cols="<,^,<",options="header"]
|===
| Server signal
| Jump ahead
| Description

| `<INTERRUPT`>
| X
| an interrupt signal

| `<DISCONNECT>`
|
| a disconnect signal
|===

[[protocol-errors]]
=== Protocol errors

If a server or client receives a message type that is unexpected, according to the transitions described in this document, it must treat that as a protocol error.
Protocol errors are fatal and should immediately transition the server state to `DEFUNCT`, closing any open connections.

[[session]]
=== Session

Each connection to the server creates a new *session* that lives until that connection is closed.
Each session is isolated and the server keeps track of the current state, based on the requests and responses exchanged within that session.
A session ends when the socket for that connection is closed.
Typically, this will be closed by the client.

[[message-exchange]]
== Message exchange

Messages are exchanged in a request-response pattern between client and server.
Each request consists of exactly one message and each response consists of zero or more detail messages followed by exactly one summary message.
The presence or absence of detail messages in a response is directly related to the type of request message that has been sent.
In other words, some request message types elicit a response that may contain detail messages, others do not.

Messages may also be pipelined. In other words, clients may send multiple requests eagerly without first waiting for responses.
When a failure occurs in this scenario, servers *must* ignore all subsequent requests until the client has explicitly acknowledged receipt of the failure.
This prevents inadvertent execution of queries that may not be valid.
More details of this process can be found in the sections below.

[[serialization]]
=== Serialization

Messages and their contents are serialized into network streams using xref:packstream/index.adoc[PackStream Specification Version 1].
*Each message is represented as a PackStream structure* that contains a fixed number of fields.
The message type is denoted by the PackStream structure *tag byte* and each message is defined in the Bolt protocol.
*Serialization is specified with PackStream Version 1*.

[[chunking]]
=== Chunking

A layer of chunking is also applied to message transmissions as a way to more predictably manage packets of data.
The chunking process allows the message to be broken into one or more pieces, each of an arbitrary size, and for those pieces to be transmitted within separate chunks.
Each chunk consists of a *two-byte header*, detailing the chunk size in bytes followed by the chunk data itself.
Chunk headers are *16-bit unsigned integers*, meaning that the maximum theoretical chunk size permitted is 65,535 bytes.

Each encoded message must be terminated with a chunk of zero size, i.e.
----
00 00
----

This is used to signal message boundaries to a receiving parties, allowing blocks of data to be fully received without requiring that the message is parsed immediately.
This also allows for unknown message types to be received and handled without breaking the messaging chain.

The Bolt protocol encodes each message using a chunked transfer encoding.

** Each message is transferred as one or more chunks of data.
** Each chunk starts with a two-byte header, an unsigned big-endian 16-bit integer, representing the size of the chunk not including the header.
** A message can be divided across multiple chunks, allowing client and server alike to transfer large messages without having to determine the length of the entire message in advance.
** Chunking applies on each message individually.
** One chunk cannot contain more than one message.
** Each message ends with two bytes with the value 00 00, these are not counted towards the chunk size (you may consider them as individual chunks of size 0).
** With version 4.1+, the `NOOP` chunk (empty chunk) is used to send an empty chunk and the purpose is to be able to support a keep alive behaviour on the connection.

==== Examples of how Bolt chunks messages

.Example of a message in one chunk
Message data containing 16 bytes:
----
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
----
results in the following chunk:
----
00 10 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 00 00
----
with the chunk header `00 10` and the end marker `00 00`.

.Example of a message split in two chunks
Message data containing 20 bytes:
----
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 01 02 03 04
----
results in chunk 1 and chunk 2:
----
00 10 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
00 04 01 02 03 04 00 00
----
with the chunk 1 header `00 01` and no end marker for chunk 1, still message data.
Chunk 2 has a header `00 04` and an end marker `00 00`.

.Example with two messages
Message 1 data containing 16 bytes:
----
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
----
Message 2 data containing 8 bytes:
----
0F 0E 0D 0C 0B 0A 09 08
----
are both encoded with chunking:
----
00 10 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 00 00

[[pipelining]]
=== Pipelining

The client may send multiple requests eagerly without first waiting for responses.


[[transaction]]
=== Transaction

A transaction is the concept of atomic units of work.

The concept of *Transaction* is when the server is in the `READY` state and the transaction is opened with the request message `RUN` and the response of a summary message `SUCCESS`.
The *Transaction* is successfully closed with the summary message `SUCCESS` for the request message `PULL_ALL` or the request message `DISCARD_ALL`.

*Version 3* of the Bolt Protocol introduces the concept of *Auto-commit Transaction* and *Explicit Transaction*.
*Auto-commit Transaction* is the server in the `READY` state and the transition to the `STREAMING` state.
The transaction is opened with the request message `RUN` and the response of a summary message `SUCCESS`.

The *Auto-commit Transaction* is successfully closed with the summary message `SUCCESS` for the request message `PULL_ALL` or the request message `DISCARD_ALL`.
Thus the *Auto-commit Transaction* can only contain one `RUN` request message.

In *version 4* of the Bolt Protocol, the `DISCARD_ALL` and `PULL_ALL` messages are renamed to `DISCARD` and `PULL` and new fields are introduced.

.Example with Bolt v4
----
...
C: HELLO ...
S: SUCCESS ...  // Server is in READY state

C: RUN ...      // Open a new Auto-commit Transaction
S: SUCCESS ...  // Server is in STREAMING state

C: PULL ...
S: RECORD ...
   ...
S: RECORD ...
S: SUCCESS ... has_more=true  // Server is still in STREAMING state

C: PULL
S: RECORD ...
   ...
S: RECORD ...
S: SUCCESS ... has_more=false  // Server is in READY state and this implies that the Auto-commit Transaction is closed.
----

[NOTE]
====
In version 1, `HELLO` is called `INIT` and Auto-commit Transaction is just Transaction.
The field `has_more=true/false` is introduced in version 4.
See also the corresponding version of the xref:bolt/server-state.adoc[].
====

The *Explicit Transaction* is introduced in *version 3* of Bolt and is a more generic transaction that can contain several `RUN` request messages.
The concept of *Explicit Transaction* is when the server is in the `READY` state and the transaction is opened with the request message `BEGIN` and the response of a summary message `SUCCESS` (thus transition into the `TX_READY` server state).

The *Explicit Transaction* is successfully closed with the request message `COMMIT` and the response of a summary message `SUCCESS`.
The result stream (detail messages) must be fully consumed or discarded by a client before the server can transition to the `TX_READY` state and thus be able to close the transaction with a `COMMIT` request message.
It can be gracefully discarded and set to the initial server state of `READY` with the request message `ROLLBACK`.

.Example with Bolt v4
----
...
C: HELLO ...
S: SUCCESS ...  // Server is in READY state

C: BEGIN ...    // Open a new Explicit Transaction
S: SUCCESS ...  // Server is in TX_READY state

C: RUN ...
S: SUCCESS ... qid=123 // Server is in TX_STREAMING state, one stream is open

C: RUN ...
S: SUCCESS ... qid=456 // Server is in TX_STREAMING state, two streams are open

C: PULL ... qid=123
S: RECORD ...
   ...
S: RECORD ...
S: SUCCESS ... has_more=true  // Server is still in TX_STREAMING state, two streams are still open

C: PULL ... qid=123
S: RECORD ...
   ...
S: RECORD ...
S: SUCCESS ... has_more=false  // Server is still in TX_STREAMING state, one stream is still open

C: PULL ... qid=456
S: RECORD ...
   ...
S: RECORD ...
S: SUCCESS ... has_more=false  // Server is in TX_READY state, all streams have been fully consumed

C: COMMIT   // Close the Explicit Transaction
S: SUCCESS  // Server is in READY state
----

[NOTE]
====
In version 3, `PULL` is called `PULL_ALL`.
Additionally, there are no fields, e.g `qid=123` and `has_more=true/false` available in version 3 of the Bolt Protocol.

[[messages]]
== Messages

There are three different kinds of messages:

** *Request message* - the client sends a message.
** *Summary message* - the server always responds with one summary message if the connection is still open.
** *Detail message* - the server always responds with zero or more detail messages before sending a summary message.

[[messages-hello]]
=== Request message - `HELLO`

The `HELLO` message request the connection to be authorized for use with the remote database and replaces the `INIT` request message of version 1 and 2.
See below for more information on `INIT`.

The server must be in the `CONNECTED` state to be able to process a `HELLO` message.
For any other states, receipt of an `HELLO` request must be considered a protocol violation and lead to connection closure.

Clients should send `HELLO` message to the server immediately after connection and process the corresponding response before using that connection in any other way.
If authentication fails, the server must respond with a `FAILURE` message and immediately close the connection.

Clients wishing to retry initialization should establish a new connection.

The `routing::Dictionary(address::String)` field is added in version *4.1* and adds an indicator if the server should carry out routing, according to the the given routing context.

[cols="<30,<40",option="header"]
|===
| `routing` values

|===

*Signature:* `01`

*Fields:*
----
extra::Dictionary(
  user_agent::String,
  scheme::String,
  routing::Dictionary(address::String),
  …
)
----

** The `user_agent` should conform to `"Name/Version"` for example `"Example/4.1.0"` (see link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent[] for more information).
** The scheme is the authentication scheme.
Predefined schemes are `"none"`, `"basic"`, and `"kerberos"`.
** The routing field should contain routing context information and the address field that should contain the address that the client initially tries to connect with e.g. `"x.example.com:9001"`.
Key-value entries in the routing context should correspond exactly to those in the original URI query string.
Setting `routing` to `null` indicates that the server should not carry out any routing.
Default: `null`.
** Further entries in extra are passed to the implementation of the chosen authentication scheme.
Their names, types, and defaults depend on that choice.
*** The scheme `"basic"` requires a user name `principal::String` and a password `credentials::String`.
*** The scheme `"bearer"` merely requires a token `credentials::String` (added in version *4.4*).

*Detail messages:*

No detail messages should be returned.

*Valid summary messages:*

** `SUCCESS`

==== Server response `SUCCESS`

A `SUCCESS` message response indicates that the client is permitted to exchange further messages.
Servers can include metadata that describes details of the server environment and/or the connection.

The following fields are defined for inclusion in the `SUCCESS` metadata:

** `server::String` (server agent string, example `"Neo4j/4.1.0"`)
** `connection_id::String` (unique identifier of the bolt connection used on the server side, example: `"bolt-61"`)
** `hints::Dictionary` (set of optional configuration hints to be considered by the driver)

The `hints` dictionary is introduced in version *4.3* and may contain a set of optional configuration hints which may be interpreted or ignored by drivers at their own discretion in order to augment operations where applicable.
A full listing of the available hints may be found in Appendix B.
Hints remain valid throughout the lifetime of a given connection and cannot be changed.
As such, newly established connections may observe different hints and/or hint values as the server configuration is adjusted.

.Example
----
SUCCESS {"server": "Neo4j/4.0.0", "hints": {"connection.recv_timeout_seconds": 120}}
----

==== Server response `FAILURE`

A `FAILURE` message response indicates that the client is not permitted to exchange further messages.
Servers may choose to include metadata describing the nature of the failure but must immediately close the connection after the failure has been sent.

.Example

[[messages-reset]]
=== Request message `RESET`

The `RESET` message requests that the connection should be set back to its initial `RESET` state, as if an `HELLO` (`INIT` in v1 and 2) had just successfully completed.
The `RESET` message is unique in that, on arrival at the server, it jumps ahead in the message queue, stopping any unit of work that happens to be executing.
All the queued messages originally in front of the `RESET` message will then be `IGNORED` until the `RESET` position is reached.
Then from this point, the server state is reset to a state that is ready for a new session.

_In version 1 and 2, the `RESET` message splits into two separate signals._
_First, an `<INTERRUPT>` signal jumps ahead in the message queue, stopping any unit of work that happens to be executing, and putting the state machine into an `INTERRUPTED` state._
_Second, the `RESET` queues along with all other incoming messages and is used to put the state machine back to `READY` when its turn for processing arrives._
_This essentially means that the `INTERRUPTED` state exists only transitionally between the arrival of a `RESET` in the message queue and the later processing of that `RESET` in its proper position._
_The `INTERRUPTED` state is therefore the only state to automatically resolve without any further input from the client and whose entry does not generate a response message._

*Signature:* `0F`

*Fields:*

No fields

*Detail messages:*

No detail messages should be returned.

*Valid summary messages:*

** `SUCCESS`
** `FAILURE`

==== Synopsis
----
RESET
----

.Example
----
RESET
----

==== Server response `SUCCESS`

If a `RESET` message request has been successfully received, the server should respond with a `SUCCESS` message and enter the `READY` state.

.Example
----
SUCCESS {}
----

==== Server response `FAILURE`

If `RESET` message is received before the server enters a `READY` state, it should trigger a `FAILURE` followed by immediate closure of the connection.
The server may attach metadata to the message to provide more detail on the nature of the failure.
Clients receiving a `FAILURE` in response to `RESET` should treat that connection as `DEFUNCT` and dispose of it.

.Example
----
FAILURE {"code": "Example.Failure.Code", "message": "example failure"}

[[messages-run]]
=== Request message `RUN`

The `RUN` message requests that a Cypher query is executed with a set of parameters and additional extra data.

In version 3+, this message could both be used in an Explicit Transaction or an Auto-commit Transaction.
The transaction type is implied by the order of message sequence.

*Signature:* `10`

*Fields:*
----
query::String,
parameters::Dictionary,
extra::Dictionary(
  bookmarks::List<String>,
  tx_timeout::Integer,
  tx_metadata::Dictionary,
  mode::String,
  db:String,
  imp_user::String
)
----

** The `query` can be a Cypher syntax or a procedure call.
** The `parameters` is a `dictionary` of parameters to be used in the `query` string.

An *Explicit Transaction* (`BEGIN`+`RUN`) does not carry any data in the extra field.

For *Auto-commit Transaction* (`RUN`) the extra field carries:

** The `bookmarks` is a list of strings containing some kind of bookmark identification e.g `["neo4j-bookmark-transaction:1", "neo4j-bookmark-transaction:2"]`.
Default: `[]`.
** The `tx_timeout` is an integer in that specifies a transaction timeout in ms.
Default: server-side configured timeout.
** The `tx_metadata` is a dictionary that can contain some metadata information, mainly used for logging.
Default: `null`.
** The `mode` specifies what kind of server the RUN message is targeting.
For write access use `"w"` and for read access use `"r"`.
Default: "w".
** The `db` specifies the database name for multi-database to select where the transaction takes place. `null` and `""` denote the server-side configured default database.
Default: `null`. (v4+)
** The `imp_user` key specifies the impersonated user which executes this transaction.
`null` denotes no impersonation (execution takes place as the current user).
Default: `null`. (v4.4+)

_Note that the `extra::Dictionary` field is added with version 3 and thus does not exist in v1 and v2._
_Additionally, the `db` field is added with version 4.0 and the `imp_user` in version 4.4 and do not exist in earlier versions._

*Valid summary messages:*

** `SUCCESS`
** `IGNORED`
** `FAILURE`

_The server must be in a `READY` state to be able to successfully process a `RUN` request._
_If the server is in a `FAILED` or `INTERRUPTED` state, the request will be `IGNORED`._
_For any other states, receipt of a `RUN` request will be considered a protocol violation and will lead to connection closure._
//is this ^ true for version 3+?

==== Server response `SUCCESS`

A `SUCCESS` message response indicates that the client is permitted to exchange further messages.

The following fields are defined for inclusion in the `SUCCESS` metadata.

** `fields::List<String>`, the fields of the return result. e.g. [“name”, “age”, …]
** `t_first::Integer`, the time, specified in ms, which the first record in the result stream is available after.

In v4+, for *Explicit Transaction* (`BEGIN`+`RUN`):

** `qid::Integer` specifies the server assigned statement ID to reference the server side result-set with commencing `BEGIN`+`RUN`+`PULL` and `BEGIN`+`RUN`+`DISCARD` messages.

.Example v3+
----
SUCCESS {"fields": ["x"], "t_first": 123}
----

.Example v4.0+
----
SUCCESS {"fields": ["x"], "t_first": 123, "qid": 7000}
----

_For v1 and v2, if a `RUN` request has been successfully received and is considered valid by the server, the server should respond with a `SUCCESS` message and enter the `STREAMING` state._
_The server may attach metadata to the message to provide header detail for the results that follow._
_Clients should not consider a `SUCCESS` response to indicate completion of the execution of that query, merely acceptance of it._
_The following fields are defined for inclusion in the metadata:_

** _`fields` (e.g. [`"name"`, `"age"`])_
** _`result_available_after` (e.g. `123`)_

.Example v1 and v2

[[messages-discard]]
=== Request message `DISCARD`

The `DISCARD` message requests that the remainder of the result stream should be thrown away.

_In v1, v2 and v3, this message is called `DISCARD_ALL`, has *no fields* and issues a request to discard the outstanding result and return to a `READY` state._
_A receiving server should not abort the request but continue to process it without streaming any detail messages back to the client._

*Signature:* `2F`

*Fields:*
----
extra::Dictionary{
  n::Integer,
  qid::Integer,
}
----

_In version 1 and 2, the server must be in a `STREAMING` state to be able to successfully process a `DISCARD_ALL` request._
_If the server is in a `FAILED` state or `INTERRUPTED` state, the request will be `IGNORED`._
_For any other states, receipt of a `DISCARD_ALL` request will be considered a protocol violation and will lead to connection closure._

==== Server response `SUCCESS`

The following fields are defined for inclusion in the `SUCCESS` metadata (v4.0+):

_In v1, v2, and v3, this message is called `PULL_ALL` and has *no fields*._
_In v1 and v2, this message issues a request to stream the outstanding result back to the client, before returning to a `READY` state._
_Result detail consists of zero or more detail messages being sent before the summary message._
_This version of the protocol defines one such detail message, namely `RECORD` (described below)._

*Signature:* `3F`

==== Server resoponse `SUCCESS`

The following fields are defined for inclusion in the `SUCCESS` metadata:

** `has_more::Boolean`, true if there are more records to stream.
If this field is not present it should be considered to default to false.

Or in the case that `has_more` is false:

==== Server response `IGNORED`

For v1 and v2, a  server that receives a `DISCARD_ALL` request while in `FAILED` state or `INTERRUPTED` state, should respond with an `IGNORED` message and discard the request without processing it.
No state change should occur.

.Example (all versions)
----
IGNORED
----

==== Server response `FAILURE`

For v1 and v2, a `DISCARD_ALL` message request cannot be processed successfully, the server should respond with a `FAILURE` message and enter the `FAILED` state.
The server may attach metadata to the message to provide more detail on the nature of the failure.

.Example (all versions)
----
FAILURE {"code": "Example.Failure.Code", "message": "example failure"}
----

==== Server response `RECORD` (in v1 and v2)

_Zero or more `RECORD` messages may be returned in response to a `PULL_ALL` prior to the trailing summary message._
_Each record carries with it *a list of values* which form the data content of the record._
_The order of the values within the list should be meaningful to the client, perhaps based on a requested ordering for that result, but no guarantees should be made around the order of records within the result._
_A record should only be considered valid if followed by a `SUCCESS` summary message._
_Until this summary has been received, the record’s validity should be considered tentative._

[[messages-route]]
=== Request message `ROUTE`

The `ROUTE` instructs the server to return the current routing table and was added in v4.3.
In previous versions there was no explicit message for this and a procedure had to be invoked using Cypher through the `RUN` and `PULL` messages.

This message can only be sent after successful authentication and outside of transactions.

*Signature:* `66`

*Fields:*
----
routing::Dictionary,
bookmarks::List<String>,
extra::Dictionary(

----
routing::Dictionary,
bookmarks::List<String>,
db:String
----

** The routing field should contain routing context information and the address field that should contain the address that the client initially tries to connect with e.g. `"x.example.com:9001"`.

*** `ttl::Integer` specifies for how many seconds this routing table should be considered valid.
*** `db::String` identifies the database for which this routing table applies (v4.4+).
*** `servers` have three elements of the type `Dictionary(addresses::List<String>, role::String)`, where `role` is one of `"ROUTE"`, `"READ"`, `"WRITE"` for exactly one entry each.
