:description: This section introduces Neo4j Driver API

= Neo4j Driver API

Neo4j Drivers export a uniform API.
This allows driver concepts and naming to be shared across ecosystems, making transition between languages and multi-language support easier and more consistent.

This section provides an overview of the following:

** <<driver-objects, Driver objects>>
** <<uri-schemes, URI schemes>>
** <<client-side-routing, Client-side routing>>
** <<client-side-logging, Client-side logging>>
** <<driver-session, Session>>
** <<driver-transaction, Transaction>>
** <<causal-chaining, Causal chaining>>

[[uri-schemes]]
== URI schemes

No TLS enabled:

** `bolt`: connect to a single Neo4j instance.
** `neo4j`: connect to a Neo4j instance and use the routing table information for further connections.

Enable TLS and allow self-signed certificate authority:

** `bolt+ssc`
** `neo4j+ssc`

Enable TLS and only allow system enabled certificate authority and verify hostname:

** `bolt+s`
** `neo4j+s`

[[client-side-routing]]
== Client-side routing

Neo4j supports a clustered setup and uses link:https://raft.github.io/[The Raft Consensus Algorithm].
See also link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.4/clustering-advanced/lifecycle/[Operations Manual -> Causal Clustering lifecycle] for more information on Causal Clustering.

Each Neo4j *Core* instance in a cluster supports `routing` and `reading`.
Only one Neo4j Core in a cluster can be selected to support `write` operations.
This selection can rotate over time.
The driver should support a *routing table*.
Read Replicas are not involved in the Raft Consensus Algorithm, but a Read Replica do return a routing table that only contain the Read Replica itself.

=== Fetching routing tables

The procedure call to fetch the routing table has changed considerably throughout the various versions of Neo4j.

=== Neo4j 4.0 Cluster and multiple databases

==== System database

** The name of the system database is fixed and named `system`.
** The system database cannot be changed for a single instance or a cluster.
** The system database exists on each instance.

==== Cluster member

A cluster contains *Core* members and *Read Replica* members.

** Each cluster member will host the exact same databases.
If an up-to-date cluster member A has databases `foo` and `system`, then all other up-to-date members in the cluster should also have and only have `foo and `system`.
However, at a given time, the cluster members may or may not be up-to-date, and as a result, cluster members may thus contain different databases.
** Only one Core at any time can be the `leader` (accept `writes`).
** Each database in a cluster has its own *raft group* and each database has its own routing table.
In other words, the leader/core/read-replica for each database in a cluster can be different.
** There is a default database for a single instance and/or a cluster.
By default, it is named as `neo4j`, but the name can be changed to something else such as `foo`.
When changing the name, a restart of the single instance and/or cluster may or may not be required.
The default database may or may not be allowed to be deleted (it cannot be assumed that there is always a default database on each instance.)
** Any Core member in a cluster can provide a routing table for any database inside this cluster.
Given a seed URL pointing to a Core member this can be used to find any databases in a cluster by fetching the routing table from a Core member.

==== Driver routing table

*The Driver should prevent the routing table from growing infinitely.*
The routing table for a specific database should be removed from the routing table if there is a failed to attempt to obtain routing information.
The routing table for a specific database should be removed from the routing table if it is invalid.
An invalid routing table could either be a:

** routing table that has timed out where the `TTL` (Time To Live) key for that routing table have ended.
** routing table that is pointing to a database that no longer exists.

This is the workflow the driver should follow when fetching a routing table for database named `foo`.

. Find the routing table for database `foo`.

. If the database does not exist in the routing table, then create an empty routing table with seed URL as initial router.

. If the routing table is stale, then refresh the routing table with a query to a cluster member that.

. If any error happens, remove the key `foo` from routing table map.

The only errors possible are:

** `SECURITY_ERROR`
** `ROUTING_ERROR`
** `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE_ERROR`, happens when the driver failed to get routing table for all existing routers.
